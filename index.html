      <div class="info-text">
        <p>
          The venue is located in Corte Franca, in the province of Brescia, close to Lake Iseo and about a 30-minute
          drive
          from the city of Brescia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The closest airport is Milano Linate, which is around a one-hour drive from the venue.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend staying in the city of Brescia at one of the hotels we’ve selected (see below), as shuttle buses
          will
          run between the city centre and the wedding venue on the day of the wedding.
