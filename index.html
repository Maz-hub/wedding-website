   Welcome to our wedding website !

We’re really looking forward to sharing this special day with you !

GETTING THERE

The venue is located in Corte Franca, in the province of Brescia, close to Lake Iseo and about a 30-minute drive from the city of Brescia.
The closest airport is Milano Linate, which is around a one-hour drive from the venue.
We recommend staying in the city of Brescia at one of the hotels we’ve selected (see below), as shuttle buses will run between the city centre and the wedding venue on the day of the wedding.

----

ACCOMMODATION

To help you plan your stay, we have selected a range of hotels in Brescia offering different styles and price options. Please note that a shuttle service to and from the wedding ceremony and reception will be provided; the pick-up and drop-off point will be located close to the Brescia train station (more details will follow).
